# Securing Embedded Systems  


## Introduction  
Embedded systems are the backbone of modern technology, playing a crucial role in operating countless devices and applications. These systems, which are specialized computers designed to perform dedicated tasks, are integrated into everything from everyday consumer electronics, such as smartphones, smart home devices, and wearables, to more complex machinery like industrial control systems, medical devices, and automotive systems.  

The versatility and efficiency of embedded systems have made them indispensable in shaping the connected world we live in today. As these systems become increasingly interconnected, the potential risks associated with their vulnerabilities also rise.  

Embedded systems often operate in environments with limited resources such as processing power, memory, and storage, making them more susceptible to security threats. Moreover, their growing connectivity to the internet and other networks opens the door to a range of security challenges.
